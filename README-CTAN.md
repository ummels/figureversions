# figureversions

### How do you like your figures?

The figureversions package defines several commands to switch between
figure versions, which determine the appearance of numbers in your
document. The package works with many font packages available on CTAN
as well as with most OpenType fonts under XeTeX and LuaTeX in combination
with fontspec.

The development of this font package is hosted at
[GitHub](https://github.com/ummels/figureversions).

## Usage

To use this package, include

    \usepackage{figureversions}

in the preamble of your LaTeX document. See the
[PDF documentation](figureversions.pdf) for details.
